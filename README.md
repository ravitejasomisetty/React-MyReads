# MyReads Project

This is the assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The goal of this project is to build MyReads app that allows user to manage their books. Books added from library belong to one of _Currently Reading, Want To Read and Read_ categories. Uses React Router to navigate between /searchbook and home pages.
